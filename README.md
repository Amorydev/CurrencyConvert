# Challenge 1: Basic Mobile Application Development

## Package and corresponding path
**`app\src\main\java\com.amory.currencyconvert`**

## Structure
The folder structure includes: activities, manager, model, retrofit, utils, viewModel
+ activities: Contains activities such as splashScreen and mainActivity.
+ manager: Is a directory containing functions that call the API using the singleton design pattern.
+ model: Contains data classes.
+ retrofit: Contains retrofit configuration and REST Api methods.
+ utils: Contains utils methods to check network connectivity.

## Architecture üèõ
Model - View - ViewModel (MVVM) is the industry recognized software architecture pattern that overcomes all drawbacks of MVP and MVC design patterns. MVVM suggests separating the data presentation logic(Views or UI) from the core business logic part of the application.

## Steps to build and run the app
1. Clone the app : [https://github.com/Amorydev/CurrencyConvert.git](https://github.com/Amorydev/CurrencyConvert.git)
2. Open folder in Android Studio
3. If you don't have an emulator installed, you need to install one first. Then launch the application.
# APIs used in the application
